# KRYPT - BLOCKCHAIN BASED CRYPTO EXCHANGE APPLICATION
Blockchain Based Crypto Exchange Application is a
decentralized crypto exchange platform. Using Blockchain
for exchanges allows for faster and less expensive
transactions. Moreover, a decentralized exchange doesn't
require investors to deposit their assets with the centralized
authority, which means they maintain greater control and
security. While Blockchain-based exchanges primarily deal in
Cryptocurrency, the concept could be applied to more
traditional investments as well
